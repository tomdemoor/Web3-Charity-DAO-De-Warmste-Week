# Building a Charity DAO

## About This Project
At the end of the day a DAO is just a group of strangers with a shared bank account that vote on how to use that bank account.
Voting powers can be made custom and transparent through a set of rules in a smart contract.

## Tools & Workflow
* Replit to deploy code & live development
* Metamask as a wallet
* AlchemyAPI to broadcast contract creation
* Rinkeby network to test
* No databases were used, all is stored on chain. Thirdweb helped to deploy the SDK for NFTs and Voting tokens
* Made with Javascript & React
